# UnitTestingPython
**Background Story:**

Gotham City is under threat! The notorious Joker has planted bugs in the Bat-Tech systems that keep Batman’s operations running smoothly. As a trusted member of Batman’s elite tech team, your mission is to write robust tests for critical components of the Bat-Tech software. Your testing skills will ensure that every gadget works flawlessly, from the Batmobile’s power calculations to the Bat-Signal’s reliability, and even monitor Joker’s mischief—all with the power of pytest.

**Objective:**
In this assignment, you will write tests for a provided Python module (bat_functions.py) using pytest. You’ll cover:
- Basic pytest syntax: Writing simple test functions and using assertions.
- Parametrization: Running tests with multiple input values.
- Fixtures: Creating reusable test setups.
- Mocking: Simulating external dependencies.
- Continuous Integration: Setting up a GitHub Actions workflow to run your tests on every push.

**Expectations:**
- Your tests should be clear, well-organized, and cover various edge cases.
- Use pytest best practices and include meaningful commit messages in your GitHub repository.
- The assignment is designed for beginners but requires careful attention to details discussed in the presentation.
